This folder contains dojox.gfx tests modified to force SVGWeb on all browsers.

NOTICE of 3rd party code included
=================================
The svgweb/ folder contains a version of svgweb (svgweb-2010-04-09) which has
been tested against dojox.gfx.

This is a separately licensed library, see COPYING.txt in svgweb/ (note that
only the binary subset of files from that project are included here).

Folder svgweb/ is used for testing only, and is not required for Dojo to work.
It can be safely removed.

To obtain SVGWeb files directly, please visit http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/
