DOH tests for Dojox Mobile.

Notes: 
1. Before running the tests, you need to ensure the browser zoom is at 1:1. This 
   impacts some of the tests which perform dimensional checks.
2. When running in IE, the following tests: ButtonsTests.html, ExpandingTextAreaTests.html, and 
   TextAreaTests.html, the dimensional checks are calibrated for execution in IE9, 
   and the checks are skipped in older IE versions.
